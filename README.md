# data-structures

In this project, My pair programming partner and I strengthened our understanding of data strucrtures by implementing popular data structures from scratch. These data structures included:
-LinkedLists
-Graphs
-HashTables
-Trees
-Binary Search Trees
-Sets
-Stack(in all types of instantiation patterns)
-Queue(in all types of instantiation patterns)


This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
